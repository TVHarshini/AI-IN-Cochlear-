# ðŸ§  AI in Cochlear â€“ Non-Surgical Hearing Assistance System

## ðŸ’¡ Project Overview

This project introduces a non-surgical, AI-powered hearing assistive system for people who cannot undergo cochlear implant surgery. It aims to use Artificial Intelligence to help users receive and interpret sounds through external devices like mobile apps or wearables â€” **without requiring surgery**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Statement

Cochlear implants require surgery, are expensive, and not accessible to everyone â€” especially in rural or underprivileged regions. Many individuals also avoid surgery due to health risks or fear.

There is a need for an **affordable, non-invasive alternative** that can still improve hearing capabilities.

## ðŸš€ Proposed Solution

The solution is an **AI-based hearing assistive system** that:

- Detects real-world sounds (e.g., speech, alarms)
- Uses AI to identify, classify, and process these sounds
- Converts the output into:
  - ðŸ“ƒ Text captions
  - ðŸ”” Visual symbols/alerts
  - ðŸ“³ Vibrations for feedback



## ðŸ‘¤ Team Details

- **Team Name**: AI in Cochlear  
- **Name**: Harshini T V  
- **Institution**: Chennai Institute of Technology  
- **Year**: 2nd Year (CSE)  
- **Role**: Solo Participant  

## ðŸ“Œ Key Highlights

- âœ… No surgery or medical procedures
- âœ… Fully non-invasive concept
- âœ… Uses existing AI speech/sound models
- âœ… Can be worn like regular accessories
- âœ… Suitable for idea-stage hackathons
- âœ… Potential to scale into a real prototype

## ðŸ“Ž Disclaimer

This is an **idea-stage submission** for a hackathon. The project is currently conceptual and **does not include code or a working prototype**. Future development may include AI model integration and wearable hardware design.
